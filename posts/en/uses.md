So I just got a new Mac earlier this month and decided it was time to do a clean setup to get rid of a lot of rubbish I had stored over the past several years, (I had been restoring from backups since 2014...) and thought I'd write this up in case anybody finds it useful.

## Browser

#### Google Chrome

The absolute first thing I do is download Google Chrome, there are a lot of useful extensions for developers out there, and so far developing on Chrome has been my preference.

#### Firefox

If I wasn't a web developer I would probably just stick with Chrome, but I keep Firefox in case something breaks on chrome, or for testing responsive web work.

## Code Editor & Terminal

#### VS Code

I've been a user of VS Code for several yars now, even though I was reluctant at first to switch Sublime Text, debugging on VS Code became the main reason why I stayed with it.

#### iTerm

The Terminal that comes as part of MacOS might be enough to start with, but iTerm is great if you want to customize the experience, specially if you spend a good part of your day looking at shell commands. I use it with zsh as my shell and use Oh My Zsh to change the style, and add a few handy plugins.

## Other Web development tools

#### Postman

My go-to app for testing and documenting API endpoints.

#### Xcode & Android Studio

Over the past 3 years I have been doing a lot of React Native development and you are going to need these 2 if you want to do too.

## Other non-web development tools

#### 1Password

I gotta say, my life would be a different one without this. All of my passwords would probably be a variation of password1 if I didn't have this installed. I use it for everything, on my phone and my computer. It comes with handy browser extensions as well.

#### CleanMyMac

I used to not really be bothered too much about my computer getting cluttered, but then I came across this app and when I noticed how much gargabe my machine was saving I made sure to run a cleanup at least every month, it also comes with a handy tool that tells you if and when specific apps are using too much power.

#### Fanstastical

I came across this awesome app a few months back and it's been amazing! I hadn't been able to find an app that would let me sync several calendars that wasn't the default MacOS Calendar.

#### Shift

I've been using this app for almost 2 years. It helps me keep everything in one place and it's been amazing for improving my productivity.

#### Sketch

I work with a lot of designers, and while there are now tools like Figma and Sketch cloud, I keep a copy of it as I still find it easier to grab assets and measurements directly from Sketch files. I also dabble with a few designs every now and then.

#### Spotify

Standard...need music to get my work done ‚ô™
