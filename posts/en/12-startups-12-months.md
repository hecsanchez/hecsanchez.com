Ever since I started buiding stuff for the web I have wanted to build something of my own, a website targetted at one of my many interests or a webapp that served an industry I wanted to be more involved in. At last, this year together with [@jailandrade](https://twitter.com/jailandrade) and [@leotrujillo](https://twitter.com/elgatoironico) we started working on something that we were passionate about and that we would be proud of after building it.

And what better way to wrap up the year [which will go down in history as one of the worst we have lived], than starting a challenge to design, build and launch 12 startups in 12 months!

### Our motivation

We have followed the journey of [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/) since he started back in 2014, many have come after him doing the same challenge, but it wasn't until I saw that Monica Lent was starting the challenge and was taking a slight different approach that got me thinking of joining, she explains her process and rules of her version of the [12 startups in 12 months](https://monicalent.com/12x-startup/) challenge.

We want to be able to work on products that motivate us and that push us to grow as _product people_. I love my current job and my team, but I am a very curious person and like many I have a very long list of ideas that would probably keep me going for several years if I worked on all of them.

### Our rules

#### Do it as a team

Instead of each of us working on their own startups, we are joining forces so that between the 3 of us end up building and launching a total of 12 startups in 12 months.

We believe that working together we can use each of our strenghts to build better products faster and even cover things that we wouldn't be able to do if each of us were doing their own stuff. At the same time we are not going to leave our full-time jobs, so we are limiting our time to only nights and weekends.

For me personally that already represents a challenge in and of itself, in the middle of a pandemic and with 3 kids at home, any time I can make it's gold :)

#### Reach out for help early

The three of us are developers, and we might not be the best at some of the areas involved in building, lauching and growing a startup, which is why we have to be honest with ourselves and instead of trying to do everything on our own we will make sure that we reach out for those who might be able avoid us going into a rabbit hole and prevent us from launching a startup in less than 30 days.

#### Focus on making money ASAP

Many have worked on side projects out of interest for the industry the project is on, or because we wanted to try the new and shiny framework or technology out there, neglecting the financial part of it. For the challenge we are using as a criteria that the potential product is able to make money from day one or as soon as possible, this helps us filter out ideas and not focus on those that might be a bit more difficult to monetize or unclear on how they can make money.

#### Bootstrap 'till the end.

While we are not married with the idea of not receiving funds, we want to do everything we can in order to keep our products running with our own funds or even better because they are generating revenue and are able to sustain themselves.
We also see it as added motivation, if we do not have the money to spend it forces us to think about ways to monetize it and build with that goal in mind.

#### Generate real value

This rule is many times skipped when building a side project, but it is important for us that we stick with it. We want to build stuff that offers real value to its users, not adding mustaches on selfies, and we are going to achieve this by listening to the users and taking their feedback into every update we do after launch.

#### Begin with a local market

We want to connect with the users of our products, understanding their problems and offering real solutikons to them with what we build, which is why we are going to focus our efforst in serving our regional market first, while remaining open to serving a wider audience if the nature of the product allows it.

#### Re-use resources from each startup

We want to opitmize the process of building each startup, so we are allowing us to re-use materials, code, templates, even design wherever possible so that we are able to achieve the goal every month.

#### Share everything in the process

We want to share our achievements as well as our mistakes with whoever would like to listen. We want to know more people that are building things, they don't necessary have to be 12 startups.

I will be documenting our progress on Twitter [@mrhecsanchez](https://twitter.com/mrhecsanchez) and Instagram [@mrhecsanchez](https://instagram.com/mrhecsanchez), and a month after every launch I will be doing a post-mortem of each startup to share lessons and apply those to the future, launching a product wil just be the beginning.

Queremos compartir nuestros errores y logros con qui√©n quiera escuchar. Si lees esto y te motiva a empezar tu propio reto escr√≠benos! Y si no, tambien! Queremos conocer a m√°s personas que quieran crear cosas, no tienen que ser 12 startups.

Yo estar√© documentando nuestro progreso en Twitter y en Instagram y un mes despu√©s de cada lanzamiento har√© un post-mortem de cada lanzamiento para compartir el progreso ya que lanzar ser√° solo el comienzo para estos productos.

### Progress of the 12 startups in 12 months

I will be updating this articule with the progress each month.

#### #1. Clasero (Diciembre)

**Status**: In progress üöß

**What is it?**
A SaaS that will allow people to generate extra income by sharing their knowledge through on-demand and live online courses.

We are pasionate about online education and we believe we can contribute with our grain of sand by building an accesible, and easy to use platform that will allow both experienced content creators and those who have never created a course to share their experience and make money at the same time.

We began coding this a few weeks ago and we have built everything from scratch. We decided to launch it as part of the challenge even thoutgh it will have taken over 30 days to complete since it is a big milestone for us and we want to take advantage of the momentum we will have as a team. We are almost ready to open up access to a limited amount of users that will be able to test out the features and we are opening up a waiting list to maintain controlled growth at the beginning.

The way we built Clasero is not how we will be building the rest of the startups, this is more of a complex platform that will allow us to have a base of resources which we can resuse on the other 11 startups.

The plan is to complete outstanding features for the first public version in a couple of weeks and close 2020 with our first startup launch.

A few things that we are complething over the next few days:

- üñ• **Generate the instructor webite dynamically.**
  Esto les va a permitir a los usuarios que sus cursos tengan un hogar y queremos hacerlo lo m√°s sencillo posible.
- üåè **Conect custom domians to the instructors' websites** A pesar de que estamos ofreciendo un subdominio de clasero personalizado de manera gratuita, consideramos importante que puedan conectar su propio dominio para unificar sus esfuerzos de branding.
- üé® **Design and build several themes.**
  We are buildling themes with designts that will adapt to the different needs of our users, focusing on improving conversions and offering a great user experience to the student.
- üìù **Content for instructors.**
  We want to offer content that offers real value to our users and that supports them in the journey to creating and running their own course site.
